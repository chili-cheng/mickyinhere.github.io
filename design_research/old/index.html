<p>
Now, it was the courage and verve of radical designers like Bucky and Moholy that drew me to design. 
I began my career as a news journalist and foreign correspondent. 
I wrote about politics, economics and corporate affairs,
 and I could have chosen to specialize in any of those fields.
 But I picked design, because I believe it's one of the most 
powerful tools at our disposal to improve our quality of life.

<p>
All of these designers and many more are pursuing their dreams, 
by the making the most of their newfound freedom, 
with the discipline of professional designers and the resourcefulness of rebels and renegades. 
And we all stand to benefit.
